      <title>DocBook plugin</title>

      <para>The original plugin did not worked for me due to missing
      dependencies, as I managed to make it work from a forked
      version, and in order to share what I learned and provide a
      sample project, I decided to fork it and publish it to my local
      ivy cache.</para>
